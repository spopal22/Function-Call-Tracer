# Function Call Tracer

This code is a program analysis unit that can be incorporated with any C program. It races the program's function calls and stores the trace results in a binary file. Then, it visualizes the traces stored in that binary file. Code instrumentation is utilized. Namely, gcc's -finstrument-functions.
